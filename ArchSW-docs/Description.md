# Description


Linear Algebra for Java (la4j) is an open-source Java library that allows its users to do operations using matrices and vectors. Initially, it was just a students' project and then it became popular. 
This isn't a project with a wide range of scenarios and applications, as it is only a library, and a very specific one, thus, the stakeholders are all and every programmer who wish to implement this library in their programs in the most convenient way. 
Within the curricular unit of Software Architecture, it's our job to evaluate la4j in terms of software architecture.
